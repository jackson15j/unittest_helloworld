Introduction
============

There's a hello world snippet of code for every language in the world, which is great. However, as a QA Engineer that is moving into Software Development, I'm more interested in how to unittest a program. In most cases the unittest frameworks exhibit one or more of these following issues:

- Assume you are an expert in the language already.
- Assume that the code under test is formatted already to be easily testable by said frameworks semmantics.
- Provide no reference to the framework (outside of a minimal tutorial or implied code inspection on the readers part).
- Provide a tutorial that skips over beginner/advanced steps.
- Documentation that does not keep step with language changes.
- Incomplete examples, examples that will never run, examples out of step with current framework.

With these annoyances I was thinking it'd be great to see examples of code written without testing in mind, then to see it converted to be testable. On the side of this thought I was debatting how ludicrous hello world would look if someone sat down and unittested it. What assumptions would they make to make it a "testable" program.
